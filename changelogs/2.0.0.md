`gitHubRelease` and `gitTagAndGitHubRelease` which are now `devOopsGitHubRelease` and `devOopsGitTagAndGitHubRelease` 
do  not upload artifacts anymore. These create GitHub releases without any artifacts. 
These do upload the changelog though. To upload artifacts, please use `devOopsGitHubReleaseUploadArtifacts` task.
